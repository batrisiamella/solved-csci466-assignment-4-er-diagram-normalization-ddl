Serenity Springs Day Spa is a full-service spa that provides hair, makeup, manicures, massages, and waxes. They would like to update their filing sytem, which has been entirely paper-based up until now. They would like to be able to automatically bill clients, remind clients of upcoming appointments, print lists of employees, print employeesâ€™ work schedules, and list the clients scheduled for a particular day.

They need to store basic information like name, phone number, physical address and email for both clients and employees. Employees have a job title, a specialty, and a pay rate that also need to be stored. Clients can choose a preferred employee for each of the services offered by the spa.

Although each employee has a specialty, they should be able to perform any of the services offered by the spa. The spa would like to be able to automatically generate a complete list of services and their prices from their new database.
